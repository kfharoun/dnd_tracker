This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## saturday notes

for tanner: 
* change booleans in ability to false (done)
* change level_learned to be the level the ability is learned, not the level of the ability 
* change magician to sorcerer (done)

gideon: 
abilities page 
* set boolean of equipped to true if clicked on, change classname to equipped or not equipped ? 
* show abilities of all abilities learned by level of that character (usecontext + dropdown?)

## sources
* used chatgpt to learn to time out an error message
